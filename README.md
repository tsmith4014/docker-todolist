Understood. If you cannot modify the Python application and need to work purely from a DevOps perspective, let's focus on creating a Docker and deployment setup that works with your existing application code. We'll follow the conventions and format from your provided Dockerfile.

### Dockerfile for `todolist-flask`

Based on your conventions, the Dockerfile for the `todolist-flask` application will look like this:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:alpine

# Environment variables for database configuration
ENV DB_USER=chandra
ENV DB_PASSWORD=Chandra@123
ENV DB_HOST=todo-database-server
ENV DB_PORT=3306
ENV DB_DATABASE=todo_db

# Install dependencies for building Python packages
RUN apk update && \
    apk add --no-cache build-base libffi-dev openssl-dev

# Copy the application files to the container
COPY . /app

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install Python dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 80

# Command to run the application
CMD python todo.py
```

### Docker Compose Setup

We'll use Docker Compose to manage both the Flask app and the MySQL database. Here's the `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:80"
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE_HOST: db
      MYSQL_DATABASE_USER: root
      MYSQL_DATABASE_PASSWORD: example
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
      MYSQL_DATABASE: todo_db
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
```

In this setup:

- The `web` service builds your Flask application using the Dockerfile.
- The `db` service runs a MySQL database.
- Environment variables are set for both services to facilitate communication.
- Port `5000` of the host is mapped to port `80` of the `web` container, and MySQL's default port `3306` is exposed for database access.

### Building and Running with Docker Compose

To build and start your services, you would run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Deployment Considerations

- For deployment, manage sensitive information like passwords and environment variables securely, possibly using secret management tools of the cloud provider or Kubernetes secrets.
- Ensure to follow security best practices, especially in production environments.
- Adjust configurations based on the target environment's requirements.

This approach should enable you to deploy the `todolist-flask` application without any changes to the application code, adhering to the DevOps responsibilities.
